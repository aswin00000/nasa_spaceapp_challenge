                        Eclipses, both solar and lunar, have captured the imagination of humanity for centuries. As we embark on this cosmic journey, let's explore these celestial events in detail.

                            Solar eclipses occur when the Moon passes between the Earth and the Sun, casting a shadow on our planet. This phenomenon is a cosmic dance that has been observed and studied for millennia.

                        <!-- How do eclipses occur? -->
                        <h3 class="section-subtitle" style="color: white;">How do eclipses occur?</h3>
                        <p class="section-content">
                            Eclipses occur when the Earth, Moon, and Sun align in such a way that one celestial body casts a shadow on another. A solar eclipse happens when the Moon comes between the Earth and the Sun, blocking the Sun's light. Conversely, a lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth passes between the Sun and the Moon, causing the Earth's shadow to fall on the Moon.
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="section-subtitle" style="color: white;">Why do only some people on Earth see an eclipse at a given time?</h3>
                        <p class="section-content">
                            Only some people on Earth see an eclipse at a given time because eclipses have a limited geographic footprint. The alignment of the Earth, Moon, and Sun creates a shadow that falls on a specific region, and only observers within that region can witness the eclipse. Those outside the shadow's path won't see the eclipse.
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="section-subtitle" style="color: white;">What causes the Sun, Moon, and Earth to align?</h3>
                        <p class="section-content">
                            The alignment of the Sun, Moon, and Earth is due to the gravitational interactions between these celestial bodies. The Moon orbits the Earth, and the Earth orbits the Sun. Occasionally, they align in a way that results in an eclipse.

                        <p class="section-content">
                            Eclipses do not occur on a daily basis. On average, there are about two to four solar eclipses and two to four lunar eclipses each year. However, the exact frequency and visibility of eclipses vary from year to year and location to location.

                        </p>

                        <p class="section-content">
                            Scientists can predict when and where eclipses will occur using mathematical models and astronomical calculations. These predictions are based on the known orbits of the Moon and Earth and take into account various factors such as the Earth's tilt and the elliptical shape of the Moon's orbit.

                        <p class="section-content">
                            The main difference between a lunar eclipse and a solar eclipse is the position of the Earth, Moon, and Sun in relation to each other. In a solar eclipse, the Moon comes between the Earth and the Sun, blocking the Sun's light and casting a shadow on the Earth. In a lunar eclipse, the Earth comes between the Sun and the Moon, causing the Earth's shadow to fall on the Moon.

                        <h3 class="section-subtitle" style="color: white;">What is an eclipse season and why do they occur approximately every six months (or twice a year)?</h3>
                        <p class="section-content">
                            An eclipse season is a period during which solar and lunar eclipses are more likely to occur. Eclipse seasons happen approximately every six months because the Moon's orbital nodes, where the Moon's path intersects with the plane of Earth's orbit around the Sun, slowly precess over time. When the Sun is near one of these nodes during a new or full moon, an eclipse can occur.
